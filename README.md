# Age Prediction from Weight And Height
This project is a Machine Learning–based system that predicts a person’s age using their physical features such as height and weight. The main objective of the project is to demonstrate how a regression model can learn patterns from data and make predictions for new inputs.

A dataset containing 5000 records of height, weight, and age is used to train the model. The Linear Regression algorithm from the Scikit-learn library is applied to understand the relationship between these features. After training, the user can enter their height and weight, and the system will predict the approximate age.

This project helps beginners understand the basic workflow of Machine Learning, including data loading, model training, and prediction. It is simple, practical, and suitable for academic and learning purposes.
